# AccessControl

#### This project is part of my final paper of my graduation in Control and Automation Engineer at Federal University of Pernambuco.   


This project aims to implement an access control using **IoT** (Internet of Things) and try to show how easy and simple is build Iot solutions with the MQTT comunication protocol. This project has a [Server](https://github.com/geraldobraz/access-control/tree/master/Server), an application software that [manage the access control](https://github.com/geraldobraz/access-control/tree/master/DA-Software) and 2 mobile applications one using [Android](https://github.com/geraldobraz/access-control/tree/master/AndroidApp) and another using [Swift](https://github.com/geraldobraz/access-control/tree/master/BanheiroWC).
